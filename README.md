# Text-to-Speech
A Text to Speech converter is a user-friendly tool that transforms written text into spoken audio. It utilizes advanced speech synthesis technology to read out the text in a natural and human-like voice. Users can simply input written content, such as documents, articles, or messages, into the converter, and it will promptly generate an audio output, eliminating the need for manual reading.

The Text to Speech converter serves as a valuable accessibility feature for individuals with visual impairments, as it allows them to consume written information through auditory means. Additionally, it proves useful in various applications, such as audiobook production, language learning, and improving overall reading comprehension. This versatile tool is widely used across digital platforms, from mobile apps and virtual assistants to navigation systems and e-learning platforms.
